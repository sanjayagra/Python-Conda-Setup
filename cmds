## Before Creating Jupyter notebook Kernel
        (hotw2) [ec2-user@ip-172-16-32-113 ~]$ which pip
        ~/anaconda3/envs/hotw2/bin/pip
        
        Activate Virtual Environment:
        Before launching Jupyter Notebook, make sure that your virtual environment is activated. You can activate it using:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate hotw2  # Unix-like
        
        Install Jupyter in the Virtual Environment:
        Ensure that Jupyter is installed within your virtual environment. If it's not installed, you can install it using:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        pip install jupyter
        Install Jupyter Kernel:
        Make sure that the Jupyter kernel is installed within the hotw2 environment. You can install it using:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        ~/anaconda3/envs/hotw2/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name=hotw2
        OR
        python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sbert-fix

        Replace hotw2 with the desired kernel name.
